# Project Documentation Goals & Guidelines

## Functional Specifications Philosophy

### UI Element Specification Approach

**Goal**: Keep functional specifications focused on user interactions, workflows, and business logic rather than prescriptive UI implementation details.

**Rationale**:
- Functional specs will be used as input for a UI design agent to create actual interface designs
- Overly-specific UI elements (buttons, dropdowns, modals) in functional specs constrain design exploration
- Mixing WHAT the system does with HOW it looks makes specs brittle and harder to maintain
- Separating concerns allows UI/UX evolution without rewriting business logic

### Guidelines

**✅ DO specify:**
- User goals and actions
- Workflows and user journeys (Select → Configure → Confirm → Execute)
- Business rules and validation logic
- State changes and system responses
- Data requirements and relationships
- Error conditions and handling
- Interaction patterns (e.g., "multi-select pattern", "confirmation flow")

**❌ AVOID specifying:**
- Exact UI components ("blue dropdown button with 15px padding")
- Visual layout details ("modal dialog with three buttons")
- Specific control types unless critical to functionality
- Colors, spacing, typography
- Precise positioning and alignment

**✔️ ACCEPTABLE (when needed for clarity):**
- General interaction types ("user selects from available options")
- Reference to established patterns ("standard bulk action flow")
- Mentioning component categories for context ("filterable list", "multi-step form")

### Documentation Structure

1. **Functional Specs** (`docs/functional/`) - Business logic, workflows, rules
2. **UI Patterns** (future: `docs/ui-patterns/`) - Reusable interaction patterns and component vocabulary
3. **UI Designs** (future) - Generated by UI agent based on functional specs + UI patterns

### Example Transformation

**Before (too prescriptive):**
```markdown
The Delete button opens a modal dialog with a warning message and two buttons: Cancel and Confirm Delete.
```

**After (interaction-focused):**
```markdown
User initiates delete action. System prompts for confirmation before executing the destructive operation. User can cancel or proceed with deletion.
```
